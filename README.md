# To Do List Project
## Description
    This project contains the files for my To-Do-List project.
    The website allows the user to add tasks to a list, mark them as complete and remove them.

## Features
    The website has a light/dark mode which changes the colour of the elements on the page using CSS classes.
    The user can add a task to a list by typing it's name and selecting the 'Add Task' button.
    The task will be green/orange depending on if it is completed/uncompleted respectively.
    The user can remove each task from the list when they want using a button.
